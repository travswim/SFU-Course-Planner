    "description": "A rigorous introduction to computing science and computer programming,
    suitable for students who already have some background in computing science and programming. 
    Intended for students who will major in computing science or a related program. Topics include: 
    fundamental algorithms; elements of empirical and theoretical algorithmics; abstract data types 
    and elementary data structures; basic object-oriented programming and software design; 
    computation and computability; specification and program correctness; and history of computing science. 
    Prerequisite: CMPT120. Co-requisite: CMPT127. Students with credit for CMPT 126, 
    128, 135 or CMPT 200 or higher may not take for further credit. Quantitative.",
